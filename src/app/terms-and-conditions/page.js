              <b>DONATION REFUND POLICY</b>
              <p>
                Kerala Pravasi Association Trust follows a consistent refund
                policy for the donors to make them feel free to correlate with
                us. We use the reliable terms and conditions for accepting the
                donations both online mode and offline mode. But if there is any
                improbable situation occurs of an incorrect deduction or if the
                donor wants to call off or deduct the donation, Kerala Pravasi
                Association Trust will extend our support within a week from the
                date of receiving the complaint from the donor. The timely
                refund of the wrongly deduced amount will depend on type of card
                used during transaction. We would require a proof of deduction
                of the donation amount and a written communication for refund
                from the donor within two days after donation. In such
                circumstances, if the receipt already has been issued, then the
                Donor need to return the original receipt at our official
                address. In the case of tax exemption certificate already
                issued, refund will not be possible.
